## TODOs & Action Items

This inventory found many references to docs and helper scripts but no centralized TODO file. To locate TODOs in source code, search for "TODO" or "FIXME". A quick scan returned matches in scripts and possibly templates. Consider running:

  grep -n "TODO\|FIXME" -R .

If you'd like, I can run a repository-wide TODO search and append results to this inventory.

## Additional Notes and Suggested Next Steps

- I focused on files that are clearly documentation-like (README, docs/, modules/*/help, templates, and scripts). If you want a deeper inventory (e.g., every template file, every docs/ subfolder, every test referencing a doc string), I can expand the list and include short excerpts for every file.
- I can also add cross-links to GitHub paths or generate a simple HTML index page under `docs/` for easier browsing.

---

If you want me to (pick any):
- Run a TODO/FIXME scan and include exact file:line excerpts.
- Expand the inventory to include every file under `templates/` and `docs/` with first-line excerpts.
- Create a `docs/INVENTORY.html` rendering this inventory for the docs site.

Tell me which and I'll continue.
