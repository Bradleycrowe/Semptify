## ❓ Common Questions

**Q: I'm over the income limit. Any help available?**
A: Maybe! Some programs use area median income (higher than poverty line). Also check nonprofit programs (many have no income limits for one-time emergency help).

**Q: I'm undocumented. Can I get help?**
A: Some programs require citizenship, but many nonprofits don't. Call 211 - they know which programs are available to everyone.

**Q: How long does it take?**
A: Varies wildly:
- Emergency LIHEAP: 18-48 hours
- Nonprofit emergency funds: 1-7 days
- Section 8: 2+ YEARS (get on waitlist NOW)
- Legal aid: Immediate for emergencies

**Q: Will this affect my immigration status?**
A: Most programs are NOT considered "public charge" under immigration law, but check with an immigration attorney if concerned. Emergency assistance is typically safe.

**Q: Do I have to pay this back?**
A: NO! These are grants/vouchers, not loans. You don't pay them back.

**Q: My landlord says they won't accept Section 8. Is that legal?**
A: Depends on your state/city. Some ban "source of income discrimination." Check with HUD counseling or legal aid.
