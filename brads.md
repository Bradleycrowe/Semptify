# 📘 Semptify Integration Brief: Law Notes Modules

## 🧭 Purpose

This system introduces three modular, multilingual, GUI-driven components to help tenants understand and act on **legal responsibility** for property management misconduct. It empowers users to trace liability across:

- 🧑‍💼 Property Managers
- 🧑‍⚖️ Supervising Brokers
- 🏠 Property Owners

Each module includes push-button flows for filing complaints, generating demand letters, and attaching evidence—no legal or technical background required.
