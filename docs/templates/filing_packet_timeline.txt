Filing Packet Timeline (Calendar Style)
======================================

Use this week-by-week plan to build your packet on a realistic schedule. Adjust dates as needed.

Week 1: Intake and Setup
- Register in Semptify (get your 24-digit key). Save it securely.
- Create a new folder in your Vault: /packet/YYYY-MM-DD/
- Write a short summary of your issue and desired outcome.
- Start an Evidence Index file.

Week 2: Gather Core Documents
- Lease and amendments; house rules; addenda.
- Key communications (letters, emails, notices) with dates.
- Receipts/invoices and payment confirmations.

Week 3: Visual and Official Records
- Photos/videos with filenames and dates.
- Inspection reports, code enforcement notices, or police reports.
- Any medical/repair estimates related to the issue.

Week 4: Witness Work
- Identify witnesses and send the Witness Statement template.
- Collect signed and dated statements.
- Save each as YYYY-MM-DD_witness_name.txt with a certificate JSON.

Week 5: Timeline and Certify
- Draft a chronological timeline (date → event → evidence references).
- Cross-check that each timeline event has supporting evidence.
- For each form you generate in Semptify, save the certificate JSON.

Week 6: Assembly and Review
- Create a cover page, summary sheet (1–2 pages), and evidence index.
- Number exhibits consistently (Exhibit 1, Exhibit 2, ...).
- Export a clean packet and store in your Vault.

Week 7: Finalize and Share
- Read the packet end-to-end; fix gaps.
- If applicable, send to mediation/advocate for feedback.
- Prepare for filing or negotiation.

Tips
- Use consistent filenames (YYYY-MM-DD_description.pdf or .txt)
- Redact sensitive data not necessary for your case
- Keep all originals; store the packet in your Vault
