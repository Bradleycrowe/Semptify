# Legal Library Module

Structured, versioned repository of tenant-facing legal references. Provides authoritative, plain-language summaries mapped to official government sources.

## Goals
- Authority: Only verifiable .gov / official judiciary sources.
- Clarity: Plain‑language summaries + glossary.
- Maintainability: Scripted validation & update workflows.
- Auditability: CHANGELOG versioning with semantic increments.

## Structure
- references/: Source JSON files + aggregated references.json
- glossaries/: Tenant-friendly term definitions
- workflows/: PowerShell maintenance scripts
- assets/: Badges, visual indicators, future diagrams

## JSON Schema (per entry)
`json

## Future Extensions
