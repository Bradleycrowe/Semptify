# Organizer and Counsel Workflow Guide

## Case intake and intake packets

- Use Community-Verified Intake to capture multilingual intake data.
- Attach initial evidence to a Rights-Ready Packet for rapid filing preparation.

## Preparing filings

- Build a Rights-Ready Packet: complaint, key evidence, witness notes, and contact info.
- Verify each fileâ€™s SHA-256 hash before creating the final packet.

## Live court walkthroughs

- Run a rehearsal in a Certified Counsel Room with Live Review enabled.
- Export annotated manifests as CSV plus a signed JSON manifest for court submission.

## Verification and credentialing

- Attorneys upload bar ID and license for Verified Certificate approval.
- Notaries complete the certified-provider handshake in Admin to access Notary Station.

## Using AI in workflows

- Assign AI roles: summarizer, drafter, red-teamer.
- Require human approval before any AI-generated document is exported or filed.
- Tag AI outputs with model name, job id, and timestamp for auditability.

## Evidence management best practices

- Upload every piece of evidence into the Evidence Hub.
- Timestamp & Lock files that will be used in filings or hearings.
- Keep a checklist per Rights-Ready Packet: files hashed, witnesses confirmed, timeline verified.
