## FAIRNESS: BAD TENANTS EXIST TOO

### System Recognizes BOTH Sides

**Good Landlords**:
- Deserve recognition certificates
- Lower intensity recommendations
- Benefit of doubt for minor issues
- Community asset acknowledgment

**Bad Landlords**:
- Higher intensity recommendations
- Escalate faster
- More venues filed with
- Public accountability

**Good Tenants**:
- Reliable, pay on time
- Respectful of property
- Communicate issues properly
- Follow lease terms

**Bad Tenants**:
- Late rent payments
- Property damage
- Lease violations
- Noise complaints

**Landlord Investment Perspective**:
- Landlords provide housing (essential service)
- Property maintenance costs money
- Fair rent = fair return on investment
- Good landlords invest in community future

### System Balance

Not all tenants are angels. Not all landlords are bad.

System provides:
- **Tenant perspective**: Filing venues, intensity scaling, outcome tracking
- **Landlord recognition**: Certificates for good landlords, reputation system
- **Fairness**: Both sides can report issues, both sides get recognition
