> Use to stay ahead of deadlines and strengthen defenses. Not legal advice.

## 1. Evidence Preparation Checklist
| Item | Action | Stored In Semptify? |
|------|--------|---------------------|
| Lease (all pages) | Upload & hash certify | ☐ |
| Rent ledger (tenant version) | Build chronology, highlight payments | ☐ |
| Payment proofs (receipts, bank) | Attach to ledger entries | ☐ |
| Repair request emails/texts | Tag as `habitability` | ☐ |
| Photos/videos of conditions | Timestamp in vault | ☐ |
| City inspection reports | Upload PDF | ☐ |
| Utility disruption logs | Note dates & duration | ☐ |
| Medical impact letters | Collect if health affected | ☐ |
| Hardship statements (employment risk) | Prepare narrative | ☐ |

## 2. Pre‑Hearing Tactical Actions
| Timing | Action | Purpose |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Immediately after service | Reconstruct service timeline | Identify dismissal motion |
| Within 24h | Log all existing habitability issues | Support escrow/counterclaims |
| 3–5 days before hearing | Request inspection (if needed) | Creates pending evidence for continuance |
| 2–3 days before hearing | Draft motions (dismiss, continue, escrow) | Ready to deploy |
| 1–2 days before hearing | Organize exhibits folder (PDFs) | Efficient remote presentation |
| Day before hearing | Tech check (camera/mic/bandwidth) | Prevent default via tech issues |

## 3. Continuance Strategy Triggers
| Trigger | Rationale | Motion Component |
|---------|-----------|------------------|
| Pending inspection within 7 days | Need objective report | Cite scheduled date |
| Awaiting rental assistance decision | Funds likely to cure | Attach application receipt |
| Recent hospitalization/medical event | Hardship + fairness | Provide brief note |
| Newly discovered service defect | Needs affidavit review | Add to dismissal grounds |

## 4. Rent Escrow Trigger Matrix
| Condition Severity | Examples | Action |
|--------------------|----------|--------|
| Critical (health/safety) | No heat, sewage backup, mold | Immediate escrow motion |
| Major (habitability) | Persistent leaks, broken locks | Escrow after documented notice |
| Moderate | Peeling paint, minor appliance issues | Track; escalate if unaddressed |
| Pattern of neglect | Multiple unresolved moderate issues | Aggregate & file escrow |

## 5. Retaliation Timeline Mapping
| Date | Tenant Protected Activity | Landlord Response | Days Until Filing | Flag? |
|------|---------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------|
|      | Complaint to city         | Threat to raise rent | 12 | ☐ |
|      | Repair email sent         | Refusal / ignored     | 20 | ☐ |
|      | Withheld portion of rent (documented) | Notice served | 5 | ☐ |

> Mark flags where filing closely follows protected activity (<30 days proximity is suspicious).

## 6. Expungement Preparation Tracker
| Factor | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Case dismissed | ☐ | Order uploaded |
| Settlement favorable | ☐ | Terms saved |
| Hardship documented | ☐ | Employment/housing letters |
| Procedural defects logged | ☐ | Service, notice, timing |
| Public interest argument | ☐ | Draft narrative |

## 7. Automation Opportunities (Semptify)
- Auto-flag rent escrow when 3+ `habitability` tags within 30 days.
- Suggest retaliation counterclaim if eviction filed <30 days after tagged complaint.
- Provide expungement prompt when judgment outcome = dismissal.
- Generate structured PDF packet of motions + evidence lists.

## 8. Multilingual Support Targets
