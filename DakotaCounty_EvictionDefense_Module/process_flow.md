## Detailed Steps

### 1. Filing
Landlord files an eviction alleging a statutory ground (nonpayment, breach, holdover, etc.). Confirm claimed ground vs. reality.

### 2. Summons Issued
Court sets hearing date. Record the date instantly in Semptify timeline. If remote: test device, bandwidth, audio.

### 3. Proper Service Requirements (Critical Defense Point)
- Must be served at least 7 days before hearing (§ 504B.321).
- Methods: Personal service; or substituted; or posted + mail (only if personal/substituted failed, with affidavit).
- If defective: Prepare Motion to Dismiss (Improper Service).

### 4. Pre‑Hearing Preparation Window
Checklist:
- Draft motions (dismiss, continue, escrow, expungement if post‑dismissal).
- Log habitability issues (use vault photo and timestamp features).
- Record all landlord communications (retaliation indicators).
- Build payment chronology.
- Prepare counterclaims (retaliation § 504B.285; habitability § 504B.161; discrimination references).

### 5. Hearing Execution (Remote)
- Join 10 minutes early.
- Have motions ready as PDF or text for judge.
- If missing evidence: request continuance (§ 504B.341) citing specificity (e.g., pending inspection report in 5 days).

### 6. Judgment Outcomes
- Dismissal: Note for future expungement.
- Continuance: Calendar new date and interim obligations.
- Writ Granted: Track issuance date; potential stay requests if severe hardship or pending aid.

### 7. Writ of Recovery & Enforcement
- Sheriff posts notice; final lockout after statutory period (often 24 hours after service or as set by writ).
- Secure belongings list, photos, medical/emergency hardship evidence for any stay attempts.

### 8. Post‑Case Actions
- Escrow release motions if rent held.
- Expungement timing: immediate if dismissed; later if settlement favorable or case resolved without judgment against tenant (§ 484.014).

### 9. Continuous Documentation
- Use Semptify vault to timestamp evidence.
- Tag entries with categories: `service`, `habitability`, `payments`, `retaliation`, `hearing`, `judgment`, `expungement`.

## Key Statutory Anchors
