SEMPTIFY CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS
=================================================================

WHAT'S ACTUALLY DEPLOYED AND WORKING ON RENDER:
-----------------------------------------------------------------
1. Homepage: templates/main_dashboard/home.html
   - 3 cards: Core explanation, Evidence storage, Library
   - Links to: /setup, /register, /docs, /learning, /cards
   
2. Vault System: blueprints/vault_bp.py
   - Routes: /vault, /notary, /certified_post, /court_clerk
   - Document uploads with certificates
   - Timeline integration
   
3. Calendar/Timeline Features:
   - calendar_api.py, calendar_master.py
   - calendar_vault_bridge.py (connects vault to calendar)
   - Templates: calendar_timeline.html, calendar_master.html
   
4. Learning/Journey System:
   - journey_routes.py, learning_routes.py
   - learning_dashboard_api.py
   - Templates: housing_journey.html, learning_dashboard.html
   
5. Storage Flow (WHAT WE JUST BUILT):
   - storage_setup_routes.py (Google/Dropbox OAuth)
   - storage_autologin.py (silent token auth)
   - vault_user_storage.py (user-owned cloud storage)
   - Templates: choose_storage.html, welcome.html

6. Document Validation:
   - Notary routes in vault_bp
   - Certificate generation with SHA-256
   - JSON metadata files

7. Engines (validation, learning):
   - engines/ directory has multiple engines
   - Learning engine, validation engine, etc.

=================================================================
THE CONFUSION:
=================================================================

YOU SAID: "we decided the way to the vault was with the calendar"
- Calendar/vault integration EXISTS (calendar_vault_bridge.py)
- But homepage doesn't link to it directly
- /setup goes to storage OAuth, not calendar

YOU SAID: "document thingy going on"
- Vault notary system EXISTS with certificates
- But home page says "Get Started" → /register (old auth)
- Should say → /setup (OAuth) → /vault

YOU SAID: "learning modules doing the journey"
- Journey routes EXIST
- But disconnected from main flow

YOU SAID: "timeline view of vault along with calendar"
- Calendar templates EXIST
- vault_bp routes EXIST
- Bridge file EXISTS
- But not integrated in user flow

=================================================================
WHAT base_page.html WAS SUPPOSED TO DO:
=================================================================

base_page.html = consistent navbar + footer for ALL pages
- Header with logo left-center
- Nav links to: Home, Vault, Calendar, Learning, Settings
- Footer with brand message
- Bootstrap 5 responsive grid
- Maroon/gold colors

PROBLEM: Forcing all 124 templates to use it would break everything

=================================================================
THE REAL ISSUE:
================================================================

The HOMEPAGE is wrong - it points to /register (old system)
Should point to: /setup (OAuth) → calendar → vault

Calendar/vault/learning/journey ALL EXIST but aren't connected

Do you want me to:
1. Just fix the homepage links (keep everything else)?
2. Map out the correct user flow through existing features?
3. Something else?
